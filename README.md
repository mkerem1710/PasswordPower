# PasswordPower

A simple and clean password strength checker. As the user types, the app instantly shows whether the password is weak, medium, or strong. It’s built only with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it works perfectly on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- No backend required
- Works on any device
